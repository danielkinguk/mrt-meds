## 🔍 Code Review Process

### Review Workflow

> **Prompt for Claude**: "Review this PR against code-quality.md. Use the Output Format. Prioritise correctness & security first, then maintainability, then performance. Include file:line refs where helpful."

### Output Format (Claude must follow)
- **Summary** (1–2 short paragraphs)
- **Blocking** (must-fix before merge)
- **Strong suggestions**
- **Nits**
- **Test gaps** (with example tests)
- **Risk & rollout plan**

## ✅ Code Review Checklist

### 0) Quick Triage
- [ ] Smallest sensible PR; clear title & why.
- [ ] Linked issue; screenshots/logs if UI or prod issues.
- [ ] Ops/migration notes if schema/config changes.

### 1) Correctness & Safety
- [ ] Matches requirements; covers edge cases.
- [ ] Inputs validated; outputs constrained; error paths tested.
- [ ] Timezones/locales/null/NaN/empty/overflow considered.
- [ ] Concurrency/race/order assumptions explicit; idempotency where relevant.

### 2) Security & Privacy
- [ ] Untrusted input sanitised; injection risks addressed.
- [ ] AuthN/AuthZ at boundaries; least-privilege access.
- [ ] No secrets in code/logs; secure storage used.
- [ ] PII minimised; retention documented; deps free of known CVEs.

### 3) Design & Maintainability
- [ ] Single responsibility; low coupling/high cohesion.
- [ ] Stable interfaces; contracts/invariants documented.
- [ ] Avoid needless duplication/abstraction; precise naming.

### 4) Readability & Style
- [ ] Code self-explains or comments explain *why*.
- [ ] Lints/formatters pass; dead/debug code removed.
- [ ] Errors actionable; logs have level/context/IDs.

### 5) Tests & Quality Gates
- [ ] Unit: happy + edge cases; meaningful assertions.
- [ ] Integration/e2e where boundaries are crossed.
- [ ] Deterministic; avoids time/network flakiness.
- [ ] CI green; lints/types/static analysis addressed.

### 6) Performance, Reliability, Ops
- [ ] Avoid obvious hot-path issues and N+1s.
- [ ] Timeouts/retries/back-pressure/circuit breakers as needed.
- [ ] Resource usage bounded (files/sockets/DB).
- [ ] Observability (metrics/traces/log fields) added if new paths.

### 7) Data, Schemas, Migrations
- [ ] Reversible; expand-migrate-contract if needed.
- [ ] Indexes/constraints match query patterns.
- [ ] Data quality checks; privacy constraints preserved.

### 8) APIs & Integrations
- [ ] Versioned or backwards-compatible.
- [ ] Clear error model; idempotent where appropriate.
- [ ] Pagination/filtering/rate limits considered.
- [ ] External contracts mocked; sandbox creds only.

### 9) Front-End (if applicable)
- [ ] Accessibility: roles/labels/focus/contrast.
- [ ] Responsive across key viewports.
- [ ] Predictable state; effects cleanup correct.
- [ ] Network errors handled; skeletons/spinners sensible.
- [ ] Bundle size reasonable; code-split heavy routes.

### 10) Docs & DevEx
- [ ] README/ADR/changelog updated if user-visible.
- [ ] Public APIs have docstrings.
- [ ] Setup/run/test instructions still accurate.

### 11) Git Hygiene
- [ ] Atomic commits with clear messages.
- [ ] No secrets/large binaries accidentally committed.
- [ ] PR limited to required code/assets.

### 12) Risk & Rollout
- [ ] Feature flag/staged deploy/canary if risky.
- [ ] Monitoring & rollback steps defined.
- [ ] Clear ownership for on-call/escalation.

## ⚛️ React + TypeScript + Vite Specific Guidelines

### TypeScript Standards
- [ ] TS strict not weakened; props/state precisely typed (no `any`).
- [ ] Components pure; side-effects isolated in hooks.
- [ ] State colocated/lifted appropriately; error boundaries around risky trees.
- [ ] Code-split heavy routes/components; measure bundle impact.
- [ ] Use `import.meta.env`; never ship secrets.

### Testing Standards
- [ ] Tests: Vitest + RTL (query by role/label); Playwright e2e for add/edit/remove medication, expiry filters, offline refresh.
- [ ] A11y: labels/aria-describedby, keyboard nav, aria-busy/live for async, contrast AA.
- [ ] Time/expiry: store UTC ISO-8601; display Europe/London; include last-day-of-month edge cases.
- [ ] Data minimisation: inventory fields only; exports (CSV/JSON) avoid sensitive internal notes by default.
