- **Batches**: Lot tracking with expiry dates
- **Items**: Individual units with location tracking
- **Locations**: Hierarchical structure (Base → Vehicle → Kit → Pouch)
- **Movements**: Stock transfer history
- **Users**: Access control and audit trails
- **Sessions**: Multi-user session management
- **Connections**: Database connection pooling
- **Operation Locks**: Concurrency control mechanisms

### Location Hierarchy
```
Base (Duddon and Furness MRT)
├── Drug Safe
├── Store
├── DM 1 (Deputy Manager 1)
│   ├── DM 1 Red Bag
│   │   └── Primary Response Kit
│   │       ├── Drugs Pouch
│   │       └── Airway Pouch
│   └── DM 1 Blue Bag
│       └── Backup Kit
└── DM 2 (Deputy Manager 2)
    ├── DM 2 Red Bag
    └── DM 2 Blue Bag
```

## 🔗 Connection Management

The application now supports multiple concurrent connections with the following features:

### Multi-Session Support
- **Session Isolation**: Each browser tab/window gets a unique session ID
- **Connection Pooling**: Up to 10 concurrent database connections
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired connections are automatically cleaned up
- **Session Persistence**: Sessions persist across page reloads

### Concurrency Protection
- **Operation Locking**: Critical operations (seeding, bulk updates) are protected
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Shared initialization prevents duplicate operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: App continues working even if some operations fail
- **Connection Monitoring**: Real-time connection status and lock monitoring

### Usage Examples
```typescript
// Get database connection (automatically managed)
const db = await getDatabaseConnection();

// Safe operations with concurrency protection
await SafeDatabaseOperations.seedDatabase();
await SafeDatabaseOperations.clearAllData();

// Monitor connections
const stats = ConnectionManager.getInstance().getConnectionStats();
```

```

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Database Management

The application uses IndexedDB for local storage. To reset the database:

1. Click "Reset Data" in the navigation bar
2. Confirm the action
3. The database will be cleared and reseeded with fresh data

## 🐛 Debugging

Debug panels are available in the application:

### Debug Panel (red "Debug" button in bottom-right corner)
- Environment information
- Database connection status
- Browser capabilities
- Storage availability

### Connection Status Panel (blue "Connections" button in bottom-left corner)
- Active connection count
- Session information
- Operation lock status
- Connection health monitoring

These are particularly useful for troubleshooting issues in different environments like CodeSandbox and monitoring multi-session usage.
